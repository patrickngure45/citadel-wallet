# TST Token Narrative - FROZEN

**Last Updated:** January 30, 2026  
**Status:** LOCKED - Do not modify without explicit approval  

---

## Core Principle

**TST is not an investment. TST is access to capability.**

Users don't acquire TST to hold it. They acquire TST because the system requires it to do something they want.

---

## What TST CAN Do

✅ **Gate Access**
- Creating P2P agreements requires TST lock
- Advanced entity compute requires TST stake
- Priority execution windows require TST hold

✅ **Enable Behavior**
- Higher capital limits at higher TST stakes
- Faster execution windows (reduced cooldowns)
- Advanced strategy parameters
- Override restrictions in edge cases

✅ **Secure Commitment**
- P2P agreement collateral (locked for deal duration)
- Entity compute reservation (locked during simulation)
- Risk override guarantee (locked until action completes)

✅ **Access Tier System**
- Tier 0: No TST required (basic deposits, simple strategies)
- Tier 1: 10 TST locked (P2P creation, priority windows)
- Tier 2: 50 TST locked (advanced entities, higher limits)
- Tier 3: 250+ TST locked (institution-grade features, custom parameters)

---

## What TST Will NEVER Do

❌ **Promise Yield**
- No "8% APY"
- No staking rewards
- No "earn TST" mechanics
- Rewards come from successful strategy execution (separate from TST)

❌ **Be Marketed as an Investment**
- Never position as "early opportunity"
- Never claim "cheap entry"
- Never use language like "initial token sale"
- Never compare to other token projects

❌ **Inflate Passively**
- No liquidity mining
- No airdrop inflation
- No dilution rewards
- Supply only contracts (through burning and locking)

❌ **Be Easily Tradeable**
- No listing on retail DEXs during Phase 1-2
- No active market making
- No price discovery until Phase 3+
- Transfer only between serious operators

❌ **Fund Development**
- No token sale to bootstrap company
- No "treasury" that dilutes holders
- Citadel is VC/revenue funded, not token funded

## User Journey (Correct Version)

### New User
"I want to create a P2P agreement."
→ System: "That requires 10 TST locked."
→ User: "Okay, where do I get TST?"
→ System: "You can acquire it from [specific paths], or earn it from strategy performance."
→ User acquires TST because they *need* it, not because they *want* it.

### Existing User
"I keep hitting cooldown limits."
→ System: "Upgrading to Tier 1 removes those limits."
→ User sees the TST requirement as a cost to solve a real problem.
→ User stakes TST.
→ Supply tightens.
→ Scarcity emerges.

### Operator
"I want to run custom entity configurations."
→ System: "Tier 3 access (250 TST) enables this."
→ Operator acquires TST as a business cost.
→ Long-term holder by default (because they're locked for active use).

## Success Metrics (Not What You'd Normally Track)

❌ **Bad Metrics (Ignore These)**
- Price increase
- Volume
- New holders
- Social mentions
- "Market cap"

✅ **Good Metrics (Track These)**
- % of TST locked in P2P agreements
- Tier 2+ users as % of total
- Average TST hold duration
- Re-stakes (users who lock more after initial lock expires)
- Usage-to-holders ratio (is TST being used or just held?)

**Benchmark for success (60 days):**
- 50–200 total TST holders
- 70%+ of supply locked
- <5% traded on any market
- Usage increasing month-over-month
- No marketing spend (organic only)

---

## Narrative Enforcement

### In Code Comments
```python
# TST is NEVER a reward mechanism
# TST is ALWAYS a requirement mechanism
# If you're tempted to "emit rewards", stop and ask:
# "Is this solving a friction point?" 
# If no, don't do it.
```

### In Documentation
- Never use "yield," "APY," "earn," or "passive"
- Always use "lock," "require," "access," "tier"
- Example: "Tier 1 access requires 10 TST locked" (not "stake 10 TST to earn rewards")

### In UI Copy
- Never show price
- Never show "buy TST"
- Always show "Action requires TST" + amount
- Example button: "Create Agreement (requires 10 TST locked)"

### In Communications (Public)
- Reference this document
- "TST growth is driven by usage friction, not marketing"
- "If you want TST before using the product, you're missing the point"

## Violation Checks

**Before shipping ANY TST feature, ask:**

1. ❓ Does this require TST or reward TST?
   - ✅ Good: "P2P creation locks 10 TST"
   - ❌ Bad: "Lock 10 TST, earn 1 TST/month"

2. ❓ Is TST solving a real friction point?
   - ✅ Good: "Advanced entities require TST stake"
   - ❌ Bad: "Hold TST to get access to rewards"

3. ❓ Would I explain this to an institutional investor?
   - ✅ Good: "TST gates access to advanced features"
   - ❌ Bad: "TST is an early-stage opportunity"

4. ❓ Does this encourage holding or trading?
   - ✅ Good: "Lock TST for P2P agreement"
   - ❌ Bad: "Buy TST now before price goes up"

## Timeline Enforcement

### Phase 0–1 (Now → 6 weeks)
- TST is invisible to external users
- Only developers/beta testers see it
- Mechanics are tested but not promoted
- No external communications

### Phase 2 (Weeks 7–12)
- TST appears in UI only when needed
- "This action requires TST"
- No price discussion
- No marketing

### Phase 3 (Months 4+)
- Public documentation of mechanics
- Selective exposure (technical audiences)
- Only after organic demand is clear

### Phase 4 (Months 6+)
- If you reach this with 100+ serious users, you can discuss TST publicly
- Still never position as investment
- Always lead with mechanics, not price

## Red Lines (If You See These, STOP)

🛑 Someone asks: "What's TST's price target?"
→ Response: "We don't discuss price. TST's value comes from access it provides."

🛑 Someone suggests: "Let's do a liquidity mining campaign"
→ Response: "No. Liquidity mining kills discipline. This is in the frozen narrative."

🛑 Someone proposes: "Why not promise 5% APY?"
→ Response: "Because passive income is unsustainable. This violates the frozen narrative."

🛑 Marketing suggests: "Let's position TST as a micro-cap opportunity"
→ Response: "No. We're attracting operators, not tourists."

🛑 You're tempted to launch on a DEX ASAP
→ Response: "Not until Phase 3 minimum. Locked narrative prevents this."

## Decision Record

**Why this narrative?**

1. **Survivability** - Tokens with clear mechanics survive. Tokens with yield promises die.
2. **Network Quality** - Friction attracts serious users. Hype attracts speculators.
3. **De-risking** - If TST fails, it's because the product failed, not the tokenomics.
4. **Defensibility** - You can't be criticized for "over-promising" if you promised nothing.

**Why lock it now?**

Because the pressure to deviate will be intense once money is involved. Freezing it now (before code ships) means you're not fighting yourself later.
